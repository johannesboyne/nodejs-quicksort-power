nodejs-quicksort-power
======================

node.js' Power! Running a quick sort algorithm with an unordered list.

I used the quicksort algorithm from http://www.sourcecodesworld.com/articles/java/java-data-structures/Optimizing_Quicksort.asp
the random array list looks like `[ 8, 2, 9, 6, 7, 3, 1, 0, 5, 4 ]` (only much longer ;)
look at the src! To execute it on your local machine, use the `run.sh`!

```shell
=> ten
10_quicksort: 0ms

=> one hundred
100_quicksort: 1ms

=> one thousand
1000_quicksort: 0ms

=> ten thousand
10000_quicksort: 2ms

=> one hundred thousand
100000_quicksort: 9ms

=> a million
1000000_quicksort: 109ms

=> ten million
10000000_quicksort: 1378ms

FATAL ERROR: JS Allocation failed - process out of memory (one hundred million digits)
```

Yeah what a pity, there we got a restriction. Sorting a one hundred million digits long array is too much. If anyone has got a solution, please share it!

**UPDATE:** I tried to implement a native quicksort version to circumvent the `JS Allocation failed Error` __BUT__ it still exists. It is simple the length of the array which makes problems! 

Try the following to convince yourself:

```shell
$ node
> function a(n) {var ar = [], i=n-1; ar.length=n; for(;i>=0;i--) {ar[i]=i;} return ar;};
undefined
> a(12)
[ 0,
  1,
  2,
  3,
  4,
  5,
  6,
  7,
  8,
  9,
  10,
  11 ]
> var _a=a(100000000); _a.length
FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_2 Allocation failed - process out of memory
```

By the way I also tried the native Array.sort() function AND we are much faster with quicksort! Look at this benchmark:

```shell
------------ testarray length: 10.000.000
quick sort: 2160ms

------------ testarray length: 10.000.000
native sort implementation: 11705ms
```

So, have fun with it!
